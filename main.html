	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	 <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of how an algorithm's running time grows with input size.
    Understanding Time complexity helps engineers choose algorithms and write code that is efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> describes how much memory an algorithm requires as input grows;
    for many common algorithms the memory usage is O(n).
